# 1 Introduction

This report documents the design, development, and implementation of a web-based reservation system for the company, Pacific Tours. The project aims to create an online system that enables customers to search, select, and reserve various hotel accommodations and tour packages that are offered by the company.

The main requirements for this system are as follows:

- Customer registration and login
- Searching and booking hotels
- Searching and booking tours
- Searching and booking packages (consisting of hotel + tour)
- Offering discounts based on booked packages
- Managing booking cancellations and modifications
- Generating booking summaries and availability reports for managers

# 2 System design and development approach

To meet the outlined requirements, a software development methodology, specifically agile, was incorporated to iteratively gather requirements, and design considerations to implement and demonstrate credible working progression within set cycles.

## 2.1 Agile software development methodology

The iterative approach to developing software has been highly beneficial to programmers to improve their skills and organisations in estimating the necessary timespan required for certain tasks [@edeki2015]. Its traits of flexibility, a clear-defined scope of requirements, quick adaptability as well and pragmatism to deliverables make it suitable for software companies to survive within evolving landscapes [@brush2022] â€“ whilst maintaining the company's business interests.

Agile programming utilises the idea of sprints, which are iterative repetitions whereby a functionality is taken and developed to produce small new increments. Each sprint follows the typical developmental phases, as seen in more traditional software methodologies such as the waterfall method. These phases include: requirements, analysis, design, evolution and delivery [@abrahamsson2017].
